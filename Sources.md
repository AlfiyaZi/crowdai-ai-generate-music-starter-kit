# Datasets

Some references to datasets that can potentially be used for training :

* [Lakh MIDI Dataset](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/)
* [MIDI Dump Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3akhxy/the_largest_midi_collection_on_the_internet/)
* [Saarland Music Data](http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/SMD/SMD_MIDI-Audio-Piano-Music.html)
* [MuseData](http://musedata.stanford.edu/)
* [Classical Piano](http://www.piano-midi.de/)
* [Bach](http://www.jsbach.net/midi/)

This list will be constantly updated. And you are welcome to send a pull request to any other datasets that you find useful.
The participants are free to use any publicly available dataset of MIDI files.
The only constraint is the output of their models should be single track MIDI files, and the evaluation interface will be an Acoustic Grand Piano soundfont to play the same.
